## Description

This application is used for developers to create a clean, simple and concise README file for their existing web applications. The developer can include detailed information about the steps taken to run their applications for better user experience. By using the command-line in the terminal, the user is prompted various details regarding their project, which then is uploaded into the formatted README file created.
